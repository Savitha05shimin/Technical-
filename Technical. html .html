        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
        and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
        example:
      </p>
<ul>
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
     For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
        For example, server-side.
        context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
        is an if statement.
      </p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>

      <code
        >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
        defined</code

      <p>
        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
            pages the global object is window,
        so you can set and access global variables using the window.
          variable syntax.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
        frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
           name.
        For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
              document, 
           you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
        parent.phoneNumber.

        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
        syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
        can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.

        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statementsis declared in a

        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
            variables. 
        If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
          represent a variable.

      Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
        true. 
      Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
           is false. An if statement looks as follows:

      <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
      condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
           Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
      condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
      statement_2 is executed.
           statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
      including further nested if statements.
      <p>
        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
        conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
      </p>
      <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; }
        else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
      </code>
      In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
      evaluates to true will be executed.
      To execute multiple statements, group
      them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
      to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

      <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                    the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
        the calling function.
